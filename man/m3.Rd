\usage{
m3(resp_cats, num_options, choice_rule = "softmax", version = "custom", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{resp_cats}{The variable names that contain the number of responses for each of the
response categories used for the M3.}

\item{num_options}{Either an integer vector of the same length as \code{resp_cats} if the number
of candidates in the respective response categories are constant across all conditions
in the experiment. Or a vector specifying the variable names that contain the number of
candidates in each response category. The order of these variables should be in the
same order as the names of the response categories passed to \code{resp_cats}}

\item{choice_rule}{The choice rule that should be used for the M3. The options are "softmax"
or "simple". The "softmax" option implements the softmax normalization of activation into
probabilities for choosing the different response categories. The "simple" option implements
a simple normalization of the absolute activations over the sum of all activations. For details
on the differences of these choice rules please see the appendix of Oberauer & Lewandowsky (2019)
"Simple measurement models for complex working memory tasks" published in Psychological Review.}

\item{version}{Character. The version of the M3 model to use. Can be one of
\code{ss}, \code{cs}, or \code{custom}. The default is \code{custom}.}

\item{...}{used internally for testing, ignore it}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{bmmmodel}
}
\description{
The Memory Measurement Model (M3) is a measurement model for working memory
tasks with categorical responses. It assumes that each candidate in each response
category is activated by a combination of sources of activation. The probability
of choosing a response category is determined by the activation of the candidates.
