\title{Create a summary of a fitted model represented by a \code{bmmfit} object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{bmmfit}(
  object,
  prob_ci = 0.95,
  priors = FALSE,
  robust = FALSE,
  mc_se = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{bmmfit}.}

\item{prob_ci}{A value between 0 and 1 indicating the desired probability
to be covered by the posterior credibility interval. The default is 0.95.}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as
the measure of central tendency and the standard deviation as
the measure of variability. If \code{TRUE}, the median and the
median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead.}

\item{...}{Other potential arguments}
