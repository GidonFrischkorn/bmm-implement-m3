fit_model(
  formula,
  data,
  model_type,
  target = NULL,
  lures = NULL,
  setsize = NULL,
  relative = T,
  parallel = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class \code{brmsformula}. A symbolic description of
the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{An object of class data.frame, containing data of all variables
used in the model. Response, target and lure values must be in radians.
There must be as many lure value columns as the maximum setsize-1. For
setsizes smaller than the maximum, values for non-existing lures must be
coded as NA. The outcome variable must be response error relative to the
target, not the raw response. Similarly, the lure values must be coded
relative to the target. If the lure values are absolute, you must subtract
from them the value of the target before running the model}

\item{model_type}{A description of the mixture model. "2p" for the 2
parameter mixture model of Zhang and Luck (2008), "3p" for the 3 parameter
mixture model of Bays et al (2009)}

\item{target}{Name of the column containing the values of the target. Only
necessary if argument \code{relative==F}}

\item{lures}{A vector of names of the columns containing the non-target
values. Only necessary if \code{model_type=="3p"}. If the response is the
response error centered on the target, then the values for the non-target
items also have to be centered on the target. If the response is the raw
response and not centered on the target, then the non-target values should
also not be centered on the target}

\item{setsize}{Name of the column containing the set size variable (if
setsize varies) or a numeric value for the setsize, if the setsize is
fixed. Only necessary if fitting the 3 parameter mixture model.}

\item{relative}{Logical; TRUE if the response is the response error centered
on the target value, and the lure positions (for the 3 parameter model) are
also centered relative to the target. FALSE if the response and the lures
are the absolute values not centered on the target. Default is TRUE.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; If TRUE, the number of cores on your machine will be
detected and brms will fit max(chains, cores) number of chains (specified
by the \code{chain} argument) in parallel using the parallel package}

\item{chains}{Numeric. Number of Markov chains (defaults to 4)}

\item{prior}{One or more brmsprior objects created by set_prior or related
functions and combined using the c method or the + operator. See also
get_prior for more help. Not necessary for the default model fitting, but
you can provide prior constraints to model parameters}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{brm()} or Stan. See the description
of \code{brm()} for more details}
}
\value{
An object of class brmsfit which contains the posterior draws along
with many other useful information about the model. Use methods(class =
"brmsfit") for an overview on available methods.

\description{
Fit a Bayesian multilevel mixture model for visual working
memory. Currently implementedare the two-parameter mixture model by Zhang
and Luck (2008), and the three-parameter mixture model by Bays et al
(2009).
