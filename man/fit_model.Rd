\usage{
fit_model(
  formula,
  data,
  model,
  parallel = FALSE,
  chains = 4,
  prior = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class \code{brmsformula}. A symbolic description of
the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{An object of class data.frame, containing data of all variables
used in the model. Response, target and lure values must be in radians.
There must be as many lure value columns as the maximum setsize-1. For
setsizes smaller than the maximum, values for non-existing non_targets must be
coded as NA. The outcome variable must be response error relative to the
target, not the raw response. Similarly, the lure values must be coded
relative to the target. If the lure values are absolute, you must subtract
from them the value of the target before running the model}

\item{model}{A description of the measurement model. "2p" for the 2
parameter mixture model of Zhang and Luck (2008), "3p" for the 3 parameter
mixture model of Bays et al (2009). "IMMabc" for the interference measurement model assuming swap
errors to occur independent of spatial proximity between target and non-target
items, "IMMbsc" for the interference measurement model assuming swap errors to occur
only as a function of spatial proximity between target and non-targets, and "IMMfull"
for the full interference measurement model accounting for swap both dependent and
independent of proximity between target and non-targets (Oberauer et al., 2017).}

\item{parallel}{Logical; If TRUE, the number of cores on your machine will be
detected and brms will fit max(chains, cores) number of chains (specified
by the \code{chain} argument) in parallel using the parallel package}

\item{chains}{Numeric. Number of Markov chains (defaults to 4)}

\item{prior}{One or more \code{brmsprior} objects created by \code{\link[brms:set_prior]{brms::set_prior()}} or related
functions and combined using the c method or the + operator. See also
\code{\link[brms:get_prior]{brms::get_prior()}} for more help. Not necessary for the default model fitting, but
you can provide prior constraints to model parameters}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link[brms:brm]{brms::brm()}} or Stan. See
the description of \code{\link[brms:brm]{brms::brm()}} for more details}
}
\value{
An object of class brmsfit which contains the posterior draws along
with many other useful information about the model. Use methods(class =
"brmsfit") for an overview on available methods.

\description{
Fit a Bayesian multilevel measurement model. Currently implemented
are the two-parameter mixture model by Zhang and Luck (2008),
the three-parameter mixture model by Bays et al (2009),
and three different versions of the Interference Measurement Model
(Oberauer et al., 2017). This is a wrapper function for \link[brms:brm]{brms::brm}, which is
used to estimate the model.
