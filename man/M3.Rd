\usage{
M3custom(resp_cats, num_options, choice_rule, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{resp_cats}{The variable names that contain the number of responses for each of the
response categories used for the M3.}

\item{num_options}{Either an integer vector of the same length as \code{resp_cats} if the number
of candidates in the respective response categories are constant across all conditions
in the experiment. Or a vector specifying the variable names that contain the number of
candidates in each response category. The order of these variables should be in the
same order as the names of the response categories passed to \code{resp_cats}}

\item{choice_rule}{The choice rule that should be used for the M3. The options are "softmax"
or "luce". The "softmax" option implements the softmax normalization of activation into
probabilities for choosing the different response categories. The "luce" option implements
the normalization of the different activations over the sum of all activations without
exponentiating them. For details on the differences of these choice rules please see
the appendix of Oberauer & Lewandowsky (2019) "Simple measurement models for complex
working memory tasks. Psychological Review"}
